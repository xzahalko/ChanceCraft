# BiomeGate
Prevent players from exploring and interacting with selected biomes. Protect your server from racing ahead lovers.

Player in selected biomes will be affected by status effect which
* reduce damage dealt
* increase damage received
* reduce sneak and increase noise
* prevent skills from raising
* prevent building (hammer, hoe, cultivator and custom hammers)
* prevent interaction with most interactable objects (ladders, boat rudder, saddle and chairs will still be available just in case)
* prevent minimap exploring

You can allow admins to ignore effect (enabled by default).

You can allow particular biome if global key is set.

Effects are configurable.

To prevent several potential issues with traversing restricted biome on a ship you will be able to
* explore minimap
* use hammer, hoe and cultivator
* interact with objects
while you stay on a ship.

It will allow you to build workbench to repair ship if needed.

It will allow searching for new lands and exploring without conquering.
